 This is a group project for the course *CZ1003: Introduction to Computational Thinking*.

 ## Project Description
 This is an NTU canteen recommender application. User can choose what category to sort the canteen on and the system must display the list of canteens according to the input. We use pygame as an external library to display the map of NTU, but input are done through the console. The project is written in Python programming language.

 ## Main Features
 - Circles indicate canteen
    - Grey means the canteen is not open
    - Red means the canteen does not satisfy the given condition
    - Green means the canteen is suitable
      - Brightness of the green indicates suitability, with lightest green as the best
 - Arrow is displayed to indicate the clicked position on the map
